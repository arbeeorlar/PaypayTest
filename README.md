# PaypayTest
Mobile Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to give us a better understanding of your coding skills. If you have any questions or need any clarifications for this challenge, please get in touch!

Goal:
Develop a Currency Conversion App that allows a user view exchange rates for any given currency
 Create a Project for a Mobile Phone
 Android: Kotlin | iOS: Swift (sorry, no Objective-C or Java please! You can learn Kotlin/Swift easily I'm sure:))
Functional Requirements:
 Exchange rates must be fetched from: https://currencylayer.com/documentation
 Use free API Access Key for using the API
 User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies provided by the API(for currencies that are not available, convert them on the app side. When converting, floating-point error is accpetable)
 User must be able to enter desired amount for selected currency
 User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
 Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)
 Write unit testing
UI Suggestion:
 Some way to select a currency
 Some text entry widget to enter the amount
 A list/grid of exchange rates
 It doesn’t need to be super pretty, but it shouldn’t be broken as well ;)
What we're looking for:
 An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
 Your coding style! Show us how you like to write your code
 Architecture, how you've structured your code
 Principles, how you belive code should be written
 Qualities, how you guarantee your code is functioning
When you're done...
Zip your completed Project and email the .zip file. If you want to instead make a github repo and just send us a link to it, that's fine too but please do not fork this repo thanks!

Have fun!
